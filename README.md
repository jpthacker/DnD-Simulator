Dungeons & Javascript - A Web-based Dungeons & Dragons-inspired text adventure!

Nology coursework: the task was to put what I knew about javascript so far to the test by making a fully functioning browser-based game. I chose to make a text-based adventure inspired by the game mechnanics behind the tabletop role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons.

To emulate the dice rolls that are a fundamental part of D&D, I sources and adapted code written by BryanBansbach (https://github.com/BryanBansbach/DiceRoller). The rest of the game is made up of original code and is a work in progress.
